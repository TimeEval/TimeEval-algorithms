The difference between real and predicted value is used as anomaly score. The parameter `window_size` acts as a kind of smoothing factor. The bigger the `window_size`, the smoother the predictions, the more values have big errors. If `window_size` is too small, anomalies might not be found. `window_size` should correlate with anomaly window sizes."

It's the t-statistics confidence coefficient. The smaller `p` is, the bigger is the confidence interval. If `p` is too small, anomalies might not be found. If `p` is too big, too many points might be labeled anomalous."
