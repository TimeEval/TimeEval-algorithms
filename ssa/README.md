## Notes

SSA works by comparing a reference timeseries to the timeseries that the experiment is being conducted on.
There are 3 main options to run SSA:

- Set `rf_method` to `all`:
- Set `rf_method` to `alpha`:
  You can now set `a` to either a float or a numpy array
  - float: wight that is used to fit the size of the reference and test timeseries
  - nparray: Array of weight used to create a reference TS from the nparray
