## Notes

The ptsa algorithms require sklearn in version 19 to 23. This is checked in the utility.py. Our python image, however, uses a newer sklearn version, which is 24.1 or higher. Hence we removed the check:

```python
if int(sklearn_version.split(".")[1]) < 19: #or int(sklearn_version.split(".")[1]) > 23:
        raise ValueError("Sklearn version error")
```

The ARIMA algorithm performs a fitted check, but that check cannot find the called function in sklearn 20 and higher - the function signature has probably changed. Because the function does not add any computation logic and we do call the fitting in algorithm.py, we removed the checking line from arima.py:

```python
#check_is_fitted(self, ['decision_scores_', 'threshold_', 'labels_'])
```

The sklearn MinMaxScaler has probably moved to a new location in sklearn version 24 or higher. Therefore, we need to import that location in arima.py as well in order to find the MinMaxScaler:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
```
