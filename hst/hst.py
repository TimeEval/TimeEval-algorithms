class HalfSpaceTrees(anomaly.base.AnomalyDetector):
    """Half-Space Trees (HST).

    Half-space trees are an online variant of isolation forests. They work well when anomalies are
    spread out. However, they do not work well if anomalies are packed together in windows.

    By default, this implementation assumes that each feature has values that are comprised
    between 0 and 1. If this isn't the case, then you can manually specify the limits via the
    `limits` argument. If you do not know the limits in advance, then you can use a
    `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` as an initial preprocessing step.

    The current implementation builds the trees the first time the `learn_one` method is called.
    Therefore, the first `learn_one` call might be slow, whereas subsequent calls will be very fast
    in comparison. In general, the computation time of both `learn_one` and `score_one` scales
    linearly with the number of trees, and exponentially with the height of each tree.

    Note that high scores indicate anomalies, whereas low scores indicate normal observations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_trees
        Number of trees to use.
    height
        Height of each tree. Note that a tree of height `h` is made up of `h + 1` levels and
        therefore contains `2 ** (h + 1) - 1` nodes.
    window_size
        Number of observations to use for calculating the mass at each node in each tree.
    limits
        Specifies the range of each feature. By default each feature is assumed to be in
        range `[0, 1]`.
    seed
        Random number seed.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from river import anomaly

    >>> X = [0.5, 0.45, 0.43, 0.44, 0.445, 0.45, 0.0]
    >>> hst = anomaly.HalfSpaceTrees(
    ...     n_trees=5,
    ...     height=3,
    ...     window_size=3,
    ...     seed=42
    ... )

    >>> for x in X[:3]:
    ...     hst.learn_one({'x': x})  # Warming up

    >>> for x in X:
    ...     features = {'x': x}
    ...     hst.learn_one(features)
    ...     print(f'Anomaly score for x={x:.3f}: {hst.score_one(features):.3f}')
    Anomaly score for x=0.500: 0.107
    Anomaly score for x=0.450: 0.071
    Anomaly score for x=0.430: 0.107
    Anomaly score for x=0.440: 0.107
    Anomaly score for x=0.445: 0.107
    Anomaly score for x=0.450: 0.071
    Anomaly score for x=0.000: 0.853

    The feature values are all comprised between 0 and 1. This is what is assumed by the model
    by default. In the following example, we construct a pipeline that scales the data online
    and ensures that the values of each feature are comprised between 0 and 1.

    >>> from river import compose
    >>> from river import datasets
    >>> from river import metrics
    >>> from river import preprocessing

    >>> model = compose.Pipeline(
    ...     preprocessing.MinMaxScaler(),
    ...     anomaly.HalfSpaceTrees(seed=42)
    ... )

    >>> auc = metrics.ROCAUC()

    >>> for x, y in datasets.CreditCard().take(2500):
    ...     score = model.score_one(x)
    ...     model.learn_one(x)
    ...     auc.update(y, score)

    >>> auc
    ROCAUC: 91.15%

    You can also use the `evaluate.progressive_val_score` function to evaluate the model on a
    data stream.

    >>> from river import evaluate

    >>> model = model.clone()

    >>> evaluate.progressive_val_score(
    ...     dataset=datasets.CreditCard().take(2500),
    ...     model=model,
    ...     metric=metrics.ROCAUC(),
    ...     print_every=1000
    ... )
    [1,000] ROCAUC: 88.43%
    [2,000] ROCAUC: 89.28%
    [2,500] ROCAUC: 91.15%
    ROCAUC: 91.15%
